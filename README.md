# OIBSIP_domain_2

# 🎯 Objective
This is a simple BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator built using Python CLI. It takes user input for weight and height (in metric units), calculates BMI, and classifies the result according to standard health ranges.

# 🛠️ Tools Used
Python 3.x: Core language used to write the script.

Built-in functions: input(), try-except, and basic math operations — no external libraries required.

# 🔄 Steps Performed
Prompt the user to enter their weight (kg) and height (m) with validation checks.

Calculate BMI using the formula: BMI = weight / (height * height).

Classify the result into categories like Underweight, Healthy, Overweight, etc.

Display additional health notes based on the BMI category.

# ✅ Outcome
Users can quickly determine their BMI and get feedback on their health status based on the result. The script handles invalid input gracefully and works entirely through the terminal.
